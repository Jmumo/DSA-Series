Unique product Write a method that, efficiently with respect to time and space used,
finds the first product in an array that occurs only once in that array. 
If there are no unique products in the array, null should be returned. For example, 
firstUniqueProduct(new String[] { "Apple", "Computer", "Apple", "Bag" }) should return "Computer".
